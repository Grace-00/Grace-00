### 👋, I'm Grace, nice to e-meet you! 👩‍💻

👩‍💻 I am a software engineer with experience in the Javascript ecosystem (Typescript, React, Next.js, Redux, Jest).

🚀 My journey: as a translator in my past life, I have discovered software development whilst creating my own website. Being curious by nature and as a life-long learner, I started self-teaching myself the necessary skills, which eventually led to contributing as a Frontend Engineer at Drops (part of Kahoot!), a beloved language-learning app boasting over 40 million users. 

🌈 My values: I enjoy being a part of international and diverse engineering teams with cultural and linguistic diversity. 

📍 I am currently looking for a new opportunity!

Current tech stack and tools: React, Next.js, Typescript, Jest, Tailwind, Storybook, Figma, Strapi.
