### 👋, I'm Grace! 👩‍💻

⭐  I'm a former translator (EN/DE > IT) turned frontend web developer. I love turning beautiful mockups into responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications.

🔛  I'm currently working towards developing my tech and communication skills as a frontend developer intern at <a href="https://www.openmindonline.it" target="_blank">openmind</a>, an Italian boutique commerce agency with a multidisciplinary consulting approach in the areas of commerce, content, strategy, experience design and technology.

## About me

💥 When I am not working on an exciting new project or learning new technologies through <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>, you can find me watching tv shows in EN/FR/DE or travelling. The latter is currently on hold for obvious reasons.

🌈 I value empathy, communication, diversity & inclusion.
